<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The automotive industry is transforming towards an environment that depends heavily on the data that underlies the essential performance and driving experience of a vehicle.
Automobiles are increasingly becoming sources of rich information for in-vehicle, cross-vehicle and cloud based applications that will improve performance, safety, efficiency, and entertainment. These applications may be designed for individual vehicles or address a wide range of them. They may also be part of a broader ecosystem that, for example, might incorporate other transportation modes, address general public safety issues and SmartCity (v2i) interactions.</p>
